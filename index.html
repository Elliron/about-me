                <p>Hi, my name is Glenn Elliron Clark, I am 35 years old and I live in Ferndale, Wa with my girlfriend Lauren.  We are currently students at Code Fellow's just starting their 201 course.  We actually just signed a lease for an apartment in Belltown, so Seattle here we come!  I decided to become a Software Developer after a friend of mine transitioned into the career, finding an avenue for a complete life change I just had to jump at the opportunity.  I have worked many jobs however one that sticks out was in a warehouse, I would spend my day on walking on concrete often times lifting heavy objects.  At the end of the day I would be to tired to do anything else, having a social life or hobbies was pretty much impossible.  When I received my check I would find that I couldn't even afford my basic bills let alone the added cost of self care from the job.  So here we are now, a budding Software Developer with aspirations of working remotely on a beach somewhere in Greece.</p>
